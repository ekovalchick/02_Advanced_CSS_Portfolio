# 02_Advanced_CSS_Portfolio

# Description
The motivation of this project is to create a portoflio to show future employers my CSS and HTML skills. I built this code to test out CSS and HTML functions and learn what additional functions I can use besides the options we were shown in class. The code solves the problem of showing a potential employer some of my talents in front end development. My biggest lesson is learning how to get image codes form the internent. Also how to start a code from scratch. It is easier to start from pre-existing code, but nice to be able to know I can start from a clean slate and create something.
